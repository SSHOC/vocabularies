Contains the current version 2 of TaDiRAH https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah2/en/ that is in use for the MP.

We used before the old version 0.5.x of TaDiRAH (http://tadirah.dariah.eu/ resp. https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH) but agreed on only using version 2, so there is a mapping between old and new version (as some sources like Tapor deliver the old version). For documenation reasons the old version is stored in the dedicated subdirectory.
