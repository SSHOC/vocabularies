* Original source: Drupal based vocabulary coming from WP6 SSH Training Discovery Toolkit plus additional concepts from CESSDA Training Ressources and prepared in ACDH-CH-Vocabseditor at ACDH-CH
* Current source: export from ACDH-CH-Vocabseditor

Used in SSH Open Marketplace for the property `intended-audience` (beware that the filename of the import dump file is used in MP for the code of the vocabulary - and here it differs from the short name used in Skosmos).
Created by WP6 for the SSH Training Discovery Toolkit and extended with concept `Data engineer`.
Additionally added CESSDA Training Ressources audiences list.

The audience.ttl is the current one in use, SSH Open Marketplace vocabs PUT expects that the filename to import is the same as the vocabulary called in SSH Open Marketplace.
