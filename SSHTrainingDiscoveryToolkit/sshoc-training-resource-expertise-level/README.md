* Original source: Drupal based vocabulary coming from WP6 training discovery toolkit and prepared in VocBench at ACDH-CH, exported and imported in ACDH-CH vocabseditor
* Current source: export from vocabseditor

Currently it is not in use anymore. Because we experienced that it is not easy applyable to training resource, therefore it is deleted from vocabulary-server. The archive is only there for history reasons.

Version history:
* 0.1.1: First export from vocabseditor on base of WP6 TDT vocabulary
* 0.2.1: changed conceptScheme url to /Scheme; removed skos:notation coming from vocabseditor
* marking it as deleted
