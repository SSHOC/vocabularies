* Original source: Drupal based vocabulary coming from WP6 training discovery toolkit and prepared in VocBench at ACDH-CH, exported and imported in ACDH-CH vocabseditor
* Current source: export from vocabseditor

Current problem: it is not in use anymore as we found out, that it is not easy to apply it to training resource, therefore it will be deleted from vocabulary-server

Version history:
  0.1.1: First export from vocabseditor on base of WP6 TDT vocabulary
  0.2.1: changed conceptScheme url to /Scheme; removed skos:notation coming from vocabseditor
